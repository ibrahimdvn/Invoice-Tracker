## About The Project

This project was developed to showcase strong front-end development fundamentals through a practical, real-world application. It is architected into two distinct parts:

1.  **A Professional Landing Page (`index.html`):** This serves as the "storefront" for the application. It's designed to attract users by clearly communicating the value proposition and benefits of the financial tracker.
2.  **A Dynamic Single-Page Application (`app.html`):** This is the core product. It features a dashboard layout that allows users to add, view, and manage their financial transactions seamlessly. All data is saved locally in the browser, ensuring user privacy and instant access without needing an account.

## Key Features

### Landing Page
* **Clear Value Proposition:** A compelling hero section that immediately explains what the app does and for whom.
* **Visual Showcase:** A clean product mockup that gives users a preview of the application's clear and organized dashboard.
* **Feature Highlighting:** A dedicated section explaining the core benefits of the application.
* **Responsive & Modern Design:** A fully responsive layout with a professional dark theme, ensuring a great experience on any device.

### Invoice Tracker Application
* **Efficient Two-Panel Layout:** A command-center style interface with controls on the left and the transaction list on the right for maximum productivity.
* **Persistent Local Storage:** All transaction data is securely saved in the browser's `localStorage`, meaning your data stays on your computer and persists between sessions.
* **Real-time Dashboard:** Summary cards for Income, Expense, and Balance update instantly as you add or remove transactions.
* **Instant Search & Filtering:** A powerful search bar allows you to filter your transaction list by description or category in real-time.
* **Clean Data Entry:** A well-organized form for adding new transactions with clear labels and input types.
* **Dynamic Table Rendering:** The transaction list is dynamically generated and updated with JavaScript, sorted by date with the newest entries on top.

## Technologies Used

This project is built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For creating a semantic and accessible structure for both the landing page and the application.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including a professional dark theme, responsive layouts using Grid, and a clean, modern aesthetic. Custom properties (variables) are used for a maintainable color scheme.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, dynamic HTML rendering, and interaction with the `localStorage` API to manage data.

**No external JavaScript frameworks or libraries were used**, demonstrating a strong command of core JavaScript.
